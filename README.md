# YOUTHRIVE-DATA-SCEINCE-CAPSTONE-PROJECTIntroduction
Project Overview

My name is Iwuegbulem Daniel, and I am currently enrolled in a Data Science program with Youthrive. This report is part of my capstone project, which focuses on applying data science techniques to real-world problems. The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a personâ€™s income exceeds $50K per year based on census data. By exploring various data features, cleaning and preparing the data, and implementing predictive algorithms, the project seeks to provide insights and accurate predictions that can help understand the key factors influencing income levels.
